# very_simple_package
This is a very simple package that I'm using to teach myself how to publish a package to Pypi

-Inside `packaging_tutorial` there is a package that I intend to publish to Pypi.

I will include steps taken later.

I am following directions from [Python Packaging User Guide > Tutorials > Packaging Python Projects](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/)
